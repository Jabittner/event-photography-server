This program is a series of php scripts that create a simple website for a on-site photographer to allow customers to browse photos and make purchase queues. Printing/Photo Editing and cash flow are left to the individual photographers. This server runs on open standards and will work with any client web browser enabled device (ipads, old computers, phones, laptops, kindles, oscilloscopes).

== More Details: ==

This system generates a on-site website, where each group of viewers can browse through a gallery of photos, generate a order list with sizes and submit it!. 

In a rush all you have to deal with is printing and payment... Not loading photos for people to view without buying. 

I was disappointed by commercial software because it would not allow for cheap hardware to be used. Most required windows, or a unique setup. This system runs on any old hardware you can find. It also is able to be run on touch screen netbooks that only run browsers.
